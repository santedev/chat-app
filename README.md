an chat app that works in real time, made with typescript and c# asp.net core httpListener

npm run watch   // to start compiling the ts from the folder ts to the folder js


npm run start   // to run the server locally, has hot reload server is made not from the normal asp.net core but httpListener work space, it doesnt use much abstraction
